	abstract = {Microbial strains have closely related genomes but may have different phenotypes in the same environment. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing can capture the genomes of all strains present in a community but strain-resolved analysis from shotgun sequencing alone remains difficult. We developed an approach to identify and interrogate strain-level differences in groups of metagenomes. We use this approach to perform a meta-analysis of stool microbiomes from individuals with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn{\textquoteright}s disease, ulcerative colitis; n = 605), a disease for which
   there are not specific microbial biomarkers but some evidence that microbial strain variation may stratify by disease state. We first developed a machine learning classifier based on compressed representations of complete metagenomes (FracMinHash sketches) and identified genomes that correlate with IBD subtype. To rescue variation that may not have been present in the genomes, we then used assembly graph genome queries to recover strain variation for correlated genomes. Lastly, we developed a novel differential abundance framework that works directly on the assembly graph to uncover all sequence variants correlated with IBD. We refer to this approach as dominating set differential abundance analysis and have implemented it in the spacegraphcats software package. Using this approach, we identified five bacterial strains that are associated with Crohn{\textquoteright}s disease. Our method captures variation within the entire sequencing data set, allowing for discovery of previously hidden disease associations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

For each distance  r, these numbers are determined by an “optimal” ordering of the vertices of G. We study the question of whether it is possible to find a single “uniform” ordering that is “good” for all distances r. We show that the answer to this question is essentially “yes”. Our results give new characterizations of graph classes with bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes.}

In this paper, we dramatically improve upon the known upper bounds for generalised colouring numbers for graphs excluding a fixed minor, from the exponential bounds of Grohe et al. to a linear bound for the r-colouring number colr and a polynomial bound for the weak r-colouring number wcolr. In particular, we show that if G excludes  Kt as a minor, for some fixed t≥4, then colr(G)≤t−12(2r+1) and wcolr(G)≤r+t−2t−2(t−3)(2r+1)∈O(rt−1). In the case of graphs G of bounded genus g, we improve the bounds to colr(G)≤(2g+3)(2r+1) (and even colr(G)≤5r+1 if g=0, i.e. if G is planar) and wcolr(G)≤(2g+r+22)(2r+1).}

abstract = {This research establishes that many real-world networks exhibit bounded expansion2, a strong notion of structural sparsity, and demonstrates that it can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms for network analysis. Specifically, we give a new linear-time fpt algorithm for motif counting and linear time algorithms to compute localized variants of several centrality measures. To establish structural sparsity in real-world networks, we analyze several common network models regarding their structural sparsity. We show that, with high probability, (1) graphs sampled with a prescribed sparse degree sequence; (2) perturbed bounded-degree graphs; (3) stochastic block models with small probabilities; result in graphs of bounded expansion. In contrast, we show that the Kleinberg and the Barabási–Albert model have unbounded expansion. We support our findings with empirical measurements on a corpus of real-world networks.}

The weak 2-coloring number wcol2(G) of G is the least k such that there is a total ordering L on V with |Wcol2[G,L,v]|≤k for all vertices v∈V.

This has motivated researchers to establish strong bounds on these parameters for various classes of graphs. Let Gp denote the pth power of G. We show that, all integers p>0 and Δ≥3 and graphs G with Δ(G)≤Δ satisfy col(Gp)∈O(p⋅wcol⌈p∕2⌉(G)(Δ−1)⌊p∕2⌋); for fixed tree width or fixed genus the ratio between this upper bound and worst case lower bounds is polynomial in p. For the square of graphs G, we also show that, if the maximum average degree 2k−2<mad(G)≤2k, then col(G2)≤(2k−1)Δ(G)+2k+1.}
