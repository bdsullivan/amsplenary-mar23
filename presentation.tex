% Abstract. 
%Over the last ten years, there has been significant work on adapting tools and techniques from structural graph algorithms for practical network analysis. One promising direction has arisen from the notion of bounded expansion, a broad notion of sparsity introduced by Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez in 2012. Bounded expansion seems to exhibit a Goldilocks-like property of both encompassing many classes of real-world networks while still admitting (theoretically) efficient parameterized algorithms for many graph optimization problems. Taken together, this suggests that it may be a rich source of efficient algorithms for analyzing real-world networks. Further, bounded expansion includes many well-studied classes (e.g. bounded degree, H-minor-free, bounded crossing number) and can be characterized by – and thus relates – a plethora of independently interesting parameters (e.g. density of shallow minors, uniform quasi-wideness, and generalized coloring numbers). Many FPT algorithms take advantage of the inherent bounds on these parameters in bounded expansion classes in order to achieve polynomial runtimes. However, in order for these approaches to be practically useful, we must understand the computability of these parameters. Existing work implicitly relies on "good enough" approximations to claim the algorithms achieve fixed-parameter tractability – for example, a -approximation for -centered colorings. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the approximation factors inherently renders the approaches infeasible on real-world instances. In contrast, other parameters characterizing bounded expansion such as the generalized coloring numbers are not even known to be NP-hard to compute exactly. In this talk, we provide an overview of this space, including new results with Breen-McKay and Lavallee on the hardness and approximability of generalized coloring numbers – parameters of independent interest which were introduced by Kierstead and Yang in 2003. We also highlight several remaining open problems where affirmative answers could move the field significantly closer to achieving its practical potential.

%BDS: Didn't quite get to making slide outline(s) for this, but did organize the content a bit. Leaning towards keeping it on the short side - I have a lot of material to fit in. Do you think it works on one slide? Or do we need two?

% Bonnet et al SODA 2021) non-constructive exponential upper bounds
% Main result: a graph G with no Ks,s-subgraph and twin-width d has scolr(G) ≤ (d^r + 3)s and one can choose G such that scolr(G) ≥ (d−4)^rs. Similar exponential upper bounds for wcol and adm.

%Recent work characterizing coloring numbers using Cops & Robbers-style game 
%https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00352
% Toruńczyk ArXiv 2023 
%Cop-Width Game: robber runs at speed r, for some fixed r ∈ N ∪ {∞}. That is, in each round, after the cops have taken off in their helicopters to their new positions, which are known to the robber, and before the helicopters have landed, the robber may traverse a path of length at most r that does not run through a cop that remains on the ground (he may also stay put). We call this game the cop-width game with radius r and width k, if there are k cops, and the robber can run at speed r. Obs: copwidth1(G) = degeneracy(G) + 1. (note to self: minimax thm comes from fact that every graph G is either d-degenerate, or it has a subgraph H in which every vertex has degree larger than d.)
%Main Result: admr (G) + 1 leq copwidthr (G) leq wcol2r (G) + 1.
% There is a variant with exact min-max theorem (cops announce moves first)
% Leads to admr (G) + 1 leq  copwidthr′ (G) leq  scolr (G) + 1
% Basically also studied in Richerby & Thilikos WG 2008 and Limnios et al TCS 2020 but without connections to coloring numbers
